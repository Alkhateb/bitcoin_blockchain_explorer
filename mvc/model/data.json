If you select the red BITCOIN_DW button on the left, this will simply take you to another earlier view. This is just to illustrate that, with an MVC framework, it is easy to swap out views.

The Visual Studio Code editor integrates a command line terminal as well as integrating to GitHub, as such I recommend that you adopt this editor for these tutorials. Exercises recommended to follow up in this tutorial are 1) writing a simple front end to experiment with the blockchain simulation more easily than using the command line, and 2) to extend your front end to exploit the MVC framework with appropriate PHD controller and model methods with the SQLite database for local storage",
