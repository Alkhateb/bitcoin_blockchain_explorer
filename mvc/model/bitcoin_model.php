<?php
// The following codes (simply echo'd out some formatting - the next version will convert to object oriented PHP and use methods)
// are adapted from Kyle Honeycutt's BTC Threads (https://btcthreads.com/lessons/), 
// which offers a number of interesting, but sparse PHP code examples
// that largely exploit the blockchain.info API for accessing the bitcoin blockchain.
// Kyle has also written a book called 'Building Bitcoin Websites - A Beginners Guide to Bitcoiun Focused Web Development',
// you can Google it and purchase it on Amazon
// Our goal will be to adapt the code on https://btcthreads.com/lessons/ and use it in a MVC design pattern 
// that will use the PHP as the data abstraction layer (DAL) for accessing the bitcoin blockchain
// Kyle also has a Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxnLeuZGAaY

// Here's the code:
